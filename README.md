# MachineLearning4IoT
Workshops and homeworks of the machine learning for IoT course

The course aims to introduce the problems related to the implementation of machine learning applications and algorithms on platforms other than high-performance servers available in the cloud.
The contents and the thus the skills acquired at the end of the course include both the hardware aspects of the problem (architectures of "edge" devices) and the software aspects (programming models, protocols and related APIs).
The skills acquired will allow a correct understanding of decentralized systems in which the flow of data is processed not only on servers, but rather locally on devices with reduced computational resources and energy.
